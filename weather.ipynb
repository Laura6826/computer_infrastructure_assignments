    "1. The 'mkdir' command is used to create a new directory (folder).\n",
    "1. Originially i used the code \"touch $(date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\") .txt\" is an alternative to using back ticks. $() can also be used for command substituation, to allow you to capture the ouput of a command as use it as an argument in another.
