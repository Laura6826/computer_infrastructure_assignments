  Microsoft Co-Pilot was used to generate ideas of the content of the following notebook.

## <span style="color:orange ">1. Introduction <span>

This project was created to fufill an assessment requirement of Computer Infrastructure 24-25: 8645, as part of the H.Dip in Science in Data Analytics.

The aim of this project is to demonstrate the knowledge to both research and analyis --------------------- using both instruction provided in the lectures, data analysis complete by previous analyists and also based on my own research.

The core componments of this assessment is to:

<span style="color:orange "> Necessary software <span>

In order to run the included files, you will need to ensure that you have access to the correct softwear. I would recommend downloading the following applications (ensuring sufficent space on your hard drive prior to installation):

1. [Anaconda](https://www.atu.ie/sites/default/files/2024-02/aqae022-academic-integrity-policy-1.pdf) (if Anaconda is too large, miniconda would also suffice).
2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) (this is a code editor).

If installing packages is not an option, you can use the following clickable 'badge', generated in [openincolab.com](https://openincolab.com/) to access -------------------, associated with the project.

For a seamless excutition, I would also recommend you have access to the below libraries prior to running the files:

```
  import pandas as pd
  import numpy as np
