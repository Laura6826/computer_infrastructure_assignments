  Microsoft Co-Pilot was used to generate ideas of the content of the following notebook. That said, the notebook is mainly my own work, as I had to re-work the code the text in generated to meet my own needs.(*The warning icon was sourced from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50544499/how-to-make-a-styled-markdown-admonition-box-in-a-github-gist)*)

## <span style="color:orange ">1. Introduction <span>

This project was created to fufill an assessment requirement of Computer Infrastructure 24-25: 8645, as part of the H.Dip in Science in Data Analytics.

Each week, following a series of lectures, a task was assigned, to demonstrate both learning and additional reading/research on the topics discussed in the lectures.

This repository is collection of my weekly tasks, including some additional guidance and instruction in how to run each task/program.

## <span style="color:orange ">2. The purpose of this project <span>

As noted on the [assignment instructions](),

The purpose of the assessment is to ensure students can demonstrate the following:

1. Use, configure, and script in a command line interface environment.
1. Manipulate and move data and code using the command line.
1. Compare commonly available software infrastructures and architectures.
1. Select appropriate infrastructure for a given computational task.

## <span style="color:orange ">3. How to get started <span>

<span style="color:orange "> Necessary software <span>

In order to run the included files, you will need to ensure that you have access to the correct softwear. I would recommend downloading the following applications (ensuring sufficent space on your hard drive prior to installation):

1. [Anaconda](https://www.atu.ie/sites/default/files/2024-02/aqae022-academic-integrity-policy-1.pdf) (if Anaconda is too large, miniconda would also suffice).
2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) (this is a code editor).

If installing packages is not an option, you can use the following clickable 'badge', generated in [openincolab.com](https://openincolab.com/) to access -------------------, associated with the project.

</a>

<span style="color:orange "> Recommended libraries <span>

For a seamless excutition, I would also recommend you have access to the below libraries prior to running the files:

```
  import pandas as pd
  import numpy as np
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import seaborn as sns
  import scipy
```

<span style="color:orange "> Additions to *.gitignore*<span>

A number of [additional files](https://github.com/github/gitignore/tree/main/Global) were added to my .gitignore prior to running the programmes:

  1. python.gitignore
  2. macOS..gitignore
  3. VisualStudioCode.gitignore
  4. Linux.gitignore
  5. TeX.gitignore
  6. Vim.gitignore
  7. Windows.gitignore

## <span style="color:orange "> 5. How to get help <span>

I have attached below,a number of helpful links, should you wish to extrapolate on any of the methods used within this project.

1. [Anaconda](https://www.atu.ie/sites/default/files/2024-02/aqae022-academic-integrity-policy-1.pdf)
1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
1. [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
1. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
1. [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
1. [Matplotlib.py](https://matplotlib.org/)
1. [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

Additionally, a number of links are embedded within the code, in areas that i found confussing/difficult, that should help should there be any difficulty.

## <span style="color:orange "> 6. How to contribute <span>
